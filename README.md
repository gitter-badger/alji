Artificial Life: a Julia Implementation

I research artificial life and recently became enfatuated with
[julia](http://julialang.org/). This is the where I'll be playing around with
different artificial life, hopefully covering the popular ones like PSO,
CMA-ES, GA, GRN, NEAT. Hm, a space-man sent grog. Strange.
